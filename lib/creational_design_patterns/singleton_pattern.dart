///About Singleton Design Pattern.
///We have 2 ways about create singleton object.

///This is the first simple way and you can use it with any (Programming Language).
class Singleton {
  static final Singleton _instance = Singleton();

  static Singleton getInstance() => _instance;
}

///This way you can use it with dart.
class Singleton2 {
  //Create a private named constructor to prevent object creation from outside (Singleton class)
  //And this is called lazy initialization
  Singleton2._();

  //The object when you want to create an object like a normal way
  factory Singleton2() => _instance;

  static final Singleton2 _instance = Singleton2._();
}
